# About this project
This project was inspired from the tutoriel that was published in Make School Web Site named React Fundamentals. 
The goal of this project is to learn the foundational concepts of React by building a web site using React. 
The site will present a list of content items, that might include a name and picture, clicking a content item will show a detail view with more information.

# Web Site goal
The goal of this project is to make a site for NPOPOS (Norway Privately Owned Public Open Spaces).
These public spaces are nice places to visit, eat your lunch, meet with friends, or do some work outside the office. The problem is many of these spaces are hard to find or people
don't know they exist. This new site is going to solve this problem by showing an image of the space, the name and address of the space, and more information such as the hours the
space is open, a description and facilities available these would be things like coffee, bathroom, art, indoors or outdoors etc.

People visiting this site could be almost anyone of almost any age:
- As a user I want to find all of the public open spaces in Norway
- As a user I want to find a public open space near me
- As a user I want to view details about pupblic open spaces I might want to visit.
