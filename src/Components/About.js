        POPOS (Privately Owned Public Open Spaces) are publicly accessible
        spaces in forms of plazas, terraces, atriums, small parks, and even
        snippets which are provided and maintained by private developers. In
        Norway, POPOS mostly appear in the forests, fjords, mountain, ranges and
        rivers.
